								<strong class="name">Amy Cyprus</strong>
								<span class="occupation">President</span>
								<p>Amy is founder and sole owner of ODI. Amy has helped transform ODI into prosperity based on her key principles of having strong relationships, having flexibility in the strategic plan and following sound policies and procedures. Amy has been involved with property management since the age of 15. She comes from a family that has always owned and managed real estate. Amy married Kip C. Cyprus, who was involved in Trust Deed sales, in 1991. After they were married, Amy and Kip ventured on their own to buy, renovate and sell property for a profit. On occasion, Amy has come across and acquired multi-family residential properties for long-term holding. She has maintained and controlled all these investments with a focus on improving the efficiency of operations. She has developed great skills in teaching her staff how to manage and deal with the increasing number of tenants. She is always on top of the current and changing laws. Amy has been in control of ODI since its inception and has acquired the knowledge to turn a profit during difficult times. As competition continues to diminish, doors are opening for the acquisition and management of more long-term properties. Amy always finds ways to increase the bottom-line and sees real opportunities with today’s market.</p>

At the age of 23, he started his own manufacturing company, making custom windows for residential homes.  Soon after, he was offered a position with Sierra Pacific Industries, where he played an integral role in operations and sales, developing the customer service, shipping and sales departments.

								<strong class="name">Christopher Newcombe</strong>
								<span class="occupation">Director of Field Operations</span>
								<p>Christopher has been with ODI and its predecessors since 1996. He has been instrumental in the transformation from its roots as a small group of investors/contractors into the dynamic, niche industry leading organization that it has grown to be today. He provides extensive experience in many key areas, including the management of construction, development and portfolio property management. Christopher earned a B.S. in Business Administration/Marketing in 1988. With a strong foundation of mechanical and technical aptitude, he developed over 10 years of industrial and technical sales successes in both the machinery and petrochemical industries prior to transitioning into the field of property development and management. Initially as an investor supervising infill development projects, Christopher quickly became skilled in construction management and low income property management. With successes in both the resale and property acquisition areas, he has also built and manages a substantial rental unit portfolio. Christopher’s 15 + years of real estate achievements are a testament to the experience and commitment he brings to this lucrative niche business.</p>
